# Awesome Map Editor
Awesome Map Editor (AME) is a map editor for 3rd generation Pokémon games: Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald.

## Dependencies
[QBoy](https://github.com/pokedude9/QBoy)
[yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)

## Getting Started
1. Place the dependencies in the same directory as the AME root. 

2. Copy `yaml-cpp.pro` from `deps` and paste it into the `yaml-cpp` root.

3. Open all the projects in Qt and set the dependencies' build directories to `bin` (relative to their individual roots). Build them!

4. Copy the `resources/config` folder into the AME executable directory.

Now you can help us develop the future of Pokémon ROM hacking!
